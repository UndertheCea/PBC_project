# PBC_project
we want to scan the invoice and provide some serivce with the line bot 
Our stuff will be stored on a server. Basically, the data we need to receive includes line commands (e.g. February invoice) and photos recognized by Line. Then, we put the recognized numbers into the database on the server.

We need to output data to that Line platform, which means we output the corresponding things depending on what the command is.
